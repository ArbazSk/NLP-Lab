You might remember when listening to your favorite music on the go meant tuning a radio, syncing an MP3 player, or adjusting a skipping portable CD player. It’s easy to forget this near-past when so much of the world’s music is available everywhere, instantly—only a search and a tap away. Music, audio books, podcasts and more can be streamed across every platform and across the globe. Behind the streaming industry’s incredible advances are decades of technical achievements in internet access, file formats, algorithms, and more.
